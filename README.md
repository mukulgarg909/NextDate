# NextDate
This java program takes input in date/mm/yyyy format only if all the input are valid i.e all test cases are included when user enters the values and produces the next date corresponding to the present date again including all the test cases for whether month has that date or not, the test case for the leap year validation and for the new year case as well.
Basically, I designed this code to test the Boundary value testing analysis on my java eclispe program  and it works properly to that and satisfy testcases for all valid as well as invalid input.
