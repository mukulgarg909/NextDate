# NextDate
This a simple Java program that takes present date as an input from the user and produces the next date corresponding to it.
This java program takes input in d/mm/yyyy format only if all the input are valid i.e all test cases are included when user enters the values and produces the next date corresponding to the present date including all the test cases for whether month has that date or not, the test case for the leap year validation and for the new year case as well.
Basically, I designed this code to test the Boundary value testing analysis and it works perfectly to that and satisfy testcases for all valid as well as invalid input.
